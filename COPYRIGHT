==========================================================================================

Starting 2010-02-18 an proprietary license originated from the computing department at BMC (UU) 
was used giving equal rights to all source code between the authors and Uppsala University:

    The source code is copyrighted, with equal shared rights, between the authors (see 
    the file AUTHORS) and the OpenExam project, Uppsala University unless otherwise explicit 
    stated elsewhere. 

This license has completely replaced with GPL 2 since version 2.2.0 of openexam-online. All
derived work (from 2.2.0 onwards) has to comply with the GPL 2 license. It's not allowed to 
borrow files and back-port into previous (an proprietary) release
