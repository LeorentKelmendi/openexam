   OPENEXAM PHP - INSTALL NOTES


** REQUIREMENTS:

   These are the requirements. Tested versions within brackets, but other
   versions might work just OK.
   
   *) PHP >= 5.2.x (need to support the new object model). [5.2.13]
   *) An SQL database (RDBS) supported by PDO. [MySQL 5.1.70]
   *) Apache web server [2.2.27]
	 
   PECL Extensions (including those builtin in PHP):
	    
   *) gettext.so  - GNU gettext  (i.e. ngettext(), _(), ...) (recommended).
   *) http.so     - HTTP extension (used to get content type of media URL's).
   *) zip.so      - For bundling results for download (recommended).
   *) curl.so     - For downloading UPPDOK data (optional).
   *) fileinfo.so - For detection of MIME type for uploaded files.

   PEAR Packages:
   
   *) phpCAS     - CAS client for PHP     (recommended).

** CONFIGURATION:

   Turn off magic quotes in php.ini:
   
     magic_quotes_gpc = Off
     magic_quotes_runtime = Off
   
   It's no longer recommended to enable magic quotes. This feature defaults 
   to off in PHP 5.3.x and is scheduled for removal in PHP 6.
   
** INSTALL:

   1. Install phpCAS from http://www.ja-sig.org/wiki/display/CASC/phpCAS:
   
        bash$> sudo pear install http://www.ja-sig.org/downloads/cas-clients/php/1.0.1/CAS-1.0.1.tgz

   3. Unpack the application archive to a directory *outside* of the web
      server (i.e. /var/www/apps/openexam-php). Go inside openexam/app/config and 
      make config protected versions of the template configuration files:
	       
        bash$> cd /var/www/apps/openexam-php/openexam/app/config
        bash$> cp apache.conf.in apache.conf
        bash$> cp config.def.in config.def

          ...

      Edit the configuration files (*.conf and *.def). Include the openexam/app/config/apache.conf 
      in your Apache server configuration.

   4. Generate the SQL database. If you are using MySQL, all you have to do
      is to connect with the client, create the database and import the SQL
      script:

        bash$> mysql -u root -p
        Enter password:
          ...
        mysql> create database openexam;
        mysql> grant select,update,insert,delete on openexam.* to openexam@localhost identified by 'password';
        mysql> flush privileges;
        mysql> use openexam;
        mysql> source /var/www/apps/openexam-php/admin/sql/openexam-php.sql
        mysql> insert into admins(user) values('username');   // Add an administrator
        mysql> exit
          ...

      Now insert the connection parameter in openexam/app/config/config.def. Repeat
      this step on any SQL-server that is going to be used for load balancing. For
      a simple setup without load balancing, the same same SQL-server (typical running 
      on localhost) is going to be used both for dbread and dbwrite.

   5. To get laguage support (translation) working, you have to compile the 
      .po files for your platform. This is done by running make in the
      package root directory:

        bash$> make

      This should compile all *.po to *.mo that can be read by PHP's GNU
      gettext extension. If the gettext extension is missing, then the
      application will always present english text.
	    
   6. The user defined setting files (*.def) should not be readable by world, 
      only by trusted users and the account the web server is running under (see 
      admin/setperm.sh):

        bash$> chmod 600 openexam/app/config/*.def
        bash$> setfacl -m u:apache:r openexam/app/config/*.def

      You are now ready to restart the web server at try it out.
