    <div style="padding-bottom:15px">OpenExam is an on line examination system that allows different types of computer-based tests and exams. It replaces traditional paper-based exams if performed in exam halls equipped with computers or in computer class rooms where restricted interned can be controlled. It may also be used for home exams and diagnostic tests on studentâ€™s personal devices. The front end of the system is entirely web based, from creating the exam to providing the students with the corrected exams.
