        * Added an result section from where students can download the result of
	  completed and all-ready decoded examinations.

        * Questions in the exam can now be answered in a 'save' and 'save and

	  of questions for each student examination out of a bank of questions.
	  
	  Each topic has an associated randomize number dictating how many
          questions to randomly select from the topic. If its zero, then all
          questions are used from that particular topic.

	  will be supported. MS Excel, plain text and XML is the supported

	* Added shared score board class. Both the corrector and decoder
	  page is now rendering the scores using the same data backend class.
	  
	* Questions can now be removed/restored after an examination has
