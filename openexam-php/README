   
   OPENEXAM PHP - SECURE ONLINE EXAMINATION OVER THE WEB
   

** GENERAL:

   OpenExam PHP is an web application for doing secure examinations over the
   web. Currently it supports freetext, single- and multiple choice
   questions. It has basic support for multimedia (adding video, audio and
   images) use in questions.

** SELF CORRECTING EXAMINATIONS:

   If questions are of single- or multiple choice type, then the answer to
   those are self correcting. The system will automatic assign an score for
   answers to these questions, but the teacher (the one correcting the exam)
   has the opportunity to override the score.

** MULTIMEDIA (VIDEO AND AUDIO):

   Multimedia is supported by adding an URL to the question. The system will
   make an HTTP HEAD request to determine the content type of the media.
   
   Different content types can be handled by different media players (actually 
   classes that generates the HTML to embed the media on the HTML page). The
   default media handling can be customized inside conf/config.inc.

** ACCESS ROLES:

   Different users can have different roles on an examination. For example,
   one or more persons might publish questions and correct answers, while
   other persons are responsible for register students and decoding result
   on the examination.
   
   This is controlled by the examination creator by granting and revoking
   roles on the examination. The different kind of roles are contributor,
   examinator and decoder.
