   OPENEXAM PHP - INSTALL NOTES


** REQUIREMENTS:

   These are the requirements. Tested versions within brackets, but other
   versions might work just OK.
   
   *) PHP >= 5.2.x (need to support the new object model). [5.2.13]
   *) An SQL database (RDBS) supported by PEAR MDB2. [MySQL 5.0.90]
   *) Apache web server [2.2.15]
	 
   PECL Extensions (including those builtin in PHP):
	    
   *) gettext.so  - GNU gettext  (i.e. ngettext(), _(), ...) (recommended).
   *) http.so     - HTTP extension (used to get content type of media URL's).
   *) zip.so      - For bundling results for download (recommended).
   *) curl.so     - For downloading UPPDOK data (optional).

   PEAR Packages:
   
   *) phpCAS     - CAS client for PHP     (required).
   *) MDB2       - Core database + driver (required).

   External programs:
   
   *) HTMLDOC    - Generate result PDF from HTML (recommended) [1.8.27].

** CONFIGURATION:

   Turn off magic quotes in php.ini:
   
     magic_quotes_gpc = Off
     magic_quotes_runtime = Off
   
   It's no longer recommended to enable magic quotes. This feature defaults 
   to off in PHP 5.3.x and is scheduled for removal in PHP 6.
   
** INSTALL:

   1. Install phpCAS from http://www.ja-sig.org/wiki/display/CASC/phpCAS:
   
        bash$> sudo pear install http://www.ja-sig.org/downloads/cas-clients/php/1.0.1/CAS-1.0.1.tgz

   2. Install HTMLDOC (optional) from http://www.easysw.com/htmldoc/:
   
        bash$> tar xfvz htmldoc-xyz.tar.gz
	bash$> cd htmldoc-xyz
	bash$> ./configure
	bash$> make
	bash$> sudo make install
	
   3. Unpack the application archive to a directory *outside* of the web
      server (i.e. /var/www/apps/openexam-php). Go inside conf and make config
      protected versions of the template configuration files:
	       
        bash$> cd /var/www/apps/openexam-php/conf
        bash$> cp apache.conf.in apache.conf

          ...

      Edit the configuration files. Include the conf/apache.conf in your
      Apache server configuration.

   4. Generate the SQL database. If you are using MySQL, all you have to do
      is to connect with the client, create the database and import the SQL
      script:

        bash$> mysql -u root -p
        Enter password:
          ...
        mysql> create database openexam;
        mysql> grant select,update,insert,delete on openexam.* to openexam@localhost identified by 'password';
        mysql> flush privileges;
        mysql> use openexam;
        mysql> source /var/www/apps/openexam-php/admin/sql/openexam-php.sql
        mysql> insert into admins(user) values('username');   // Add an administrator
        mysql> exit
          ...

      Now insert the connection parameter in conf/database.conf

   5. To get laguage support (translation) working, you have to compile the 
      .po files for your platform. This is done by running make in the
      package root directory:

        bash$> make

      This should compile all *.po to *.mo that can be read by PHP's GNU
      gettext extension. If the gettext extension is missing, then the
      application will always present english text.
	    
   6. The two files conf/config.inc and conf/database.conf should not be
      readable by world, only by trusted users and the account the web
      server is running under (see admin/setperm.sh):

        bash$> chmod 600 conf/config.inc conf/database.conf
        bash$> setfacl -m u:apache:r conf/config.inc conf/database.conf

      You are now ready to restart the web server at try it out.
