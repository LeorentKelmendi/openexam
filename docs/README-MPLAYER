   MEDIA PLAYER (MULTIMEDIA) SUPPORT
   
** INTRODUCTION:

   OpenExam PHP can use multimedia (video, audio and images) as a question
   feature. The media players are defined in include/mplayer.inc and
   configured in conf/config.inc (using the class MediaPlayerConfig).
   
** HOW IT WORKS:

   For each question having an video or audio URL, a HTTP HEAD request is
   sent to determine the content type. The content type is used to decide
   what media player object to create.
   
   The media player object gets called to output HTML code to embed the
   browser media plugin on the question page.
   
   The class MediaPlayerFactory inside include/mplayer.inc is responsible
   for creating the appropriate media player based on the content type. It
   uses a builtin map, and if configured, information provided by the system
   manager to decide the type of media player to create (see section on configure
   content type handler below).
   
** CONFIGURE CONTENT TYPE HANDLERS:

   The system manager can override the media player created by the factory 
   class by defining the class MediaPlayerConfig in conf/config.inc. 
   
   This makes it possible for the system manager to define different policys
   for media playback depending on the client computers capabilities (in an
   a situation where the system manager has complete control over the client
   computers).

   For example, it's possible for the system manager to define that the VLC
   plugin should handle all media, except for flash that is handled by the
   native flash plugin.

** THE GENERIC MEDIA PLAYER:

   The application has an "generic" media player that is not associated with
   any plugin. Instead, it outputs HTML code for embedding a browser plugin on 
   the page, but leave it to the browser to decide which plugin to actually
   use.

** EXAMPLES:

   These are example classes for include/config.inc to configure content
   type handling.

   Example 1. 
   
     // 
     // Use VLC for all media except for flash that is handled by the native
     // plugin:
     // 
     class MediaPlayerConfig
     {
         public function getPlayerId($content) 
         {
             switch($content) {
                 case "application/x-shockwave-flash":
                 case "video/x-flv":
                     return MEDIA_PLAYER_ADOBE_FLASH;
             }
             return MEDIA_PLAYER_VIDEOLAN;
         }
     }

   Example 2.
   
     // 
     // Override handling of QuickTime and MPEG-4:
     // 
     class MediaPlayerConfig
     {
         public function getPlayerId($content) 
         {
             switch($content) {
                 case "video/quicktime":
                     return MEDIA_PLAYER_VIDEOLAN;
                 case "audio/mp4":
                 case "audio/mp4":
                     return MEDIA_PLAYER_ADOBE_FLASH;
             }

             // 
             // Use builtin config for all other content:
             // 
             return MEDIA_PLAYER_BUILTIN;
	 }
     }

   Example 3.
   
     // 
     // Let the generic media player handle all content:
     // 
     class MediaPlayerConfig
     {
         public function getPlayerId($content) 
         {
             return MEDIA_PLAYER_GENERIC;
	 }
     }

   Example 4.
   
     // 
     // Use the VLC plugin for all content:
     // 
     class MediaPlayerConfig
     {
         public function getPlayerId($content) 
         {
	     return MEDIA_PLAYER_VIDEOLAN;
	 }
     }
