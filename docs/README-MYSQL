   NOTES FOR MYSQL SERVER


** SAVING LARGE ANSWERS:

   In previous version of OpenExam, answers were stored in a TEXT field, 
   limiting the answers to ~16kB (2^8 bytes). It has been seen that this field
   is too small, so it has been changed to MEDIUMTEXT, giving ~16MB as upper 
   limit.

   The default max single SQL statement accepted by MySQL is 1MB. Too actually
   save answers larger than 1MB a few configurations has to be done:

     1. Modify post_max_size in php.ini
     2. Modify max_allowed_packet in my.cnf

   This text snippet from MySQL reference manual explain this:

   "  ...

    The server's default max_allowed_packet value is 1MB. You can increase this 
    if the server needs to handle big queries (for example, if you are working 
    with big BLOB columns). For example, to set the variable to 16MB, start the 
    server like this:

    shell> mysqld --max_allowed_packet=16M
    You can also use an option file to set max_allowed_packet. For example, to 
    set the size for the server to 16MB, add the following lines in an option 
    file:

    [mysqld]
    max_allowed_packet=16M

      ..."
