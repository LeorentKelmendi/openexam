   README FOR LATEX HANDLER

** GENERAL:

   The system has built-in support for embedding LaTeX code inside the question 
   text. As the rendering of LaTeX -> PNG is done by external programs, these
   has to be setup properly.

** REQUIRED APPLICATIONS:

   The rendering is done using a two-step pipe using the pdftex and dvipng 
   command.

** INSTALL:

   These instructions are for Gentoo Linux. Install these packages:

        o) dev-texlive/texlive-latex   (2010)
        o) app-text/dvipng             (1.13)

   Make sure that USE flags for app-text/dvipng contains truetype.

** TESTING:

   The picture is generated from LaTeX by the class LatexHandler defined in 
   include/handler/latex.inc.

   The handler can be tested either by defining a question having LaTeX code 
   withing '<%latex ... %> tags or by passing the code direct to the image 
   handler script:

     http://localhost/openexam/images/handler.php?type=latex&data=...

   The data argument should be the LaTeX code encoded by urlencode().
