   
   OPENEXAM PHP - SECURE ONLINE EXAMINATION OVER THE WEB
   

** GENERAL:

   OpenExam PHP is an web application for doing secure examinations over the
   web. Currently it supports freetext, single- and multiple choice
   questions. It has basic support for multimedia (adding video, audio and
   images) use in questions.

** SELF CORRECTING EXAMINATIONS:

   If questions are of single- or multiple choice type, then the answer to
   those are self correcting. The system will automatic assign an score for
   answers to these questions, but the teacher (the one correcting the exam)
   has the opportunity to override the score.

** MULTIMEDIA (IMAGE, VIDEO AND AUDIO):

   Multimedia is supported by uploading files as question resources. The system
   will automatic determine the MIME-type and generate apropriate HTML tags to
   visualize the resource file.

** RESOURCE FILES (I.E EXCEL OR PDF):

   Resource files an be uploaded the same way as multimedia. System will take
   care of embedding the resource file to make it visible for students during
   the exam.

** ACCESS ROLES:

   Different users can have different roles on an examination. For example,
   one or more persons might publish questions and correct answers, while
   other persons are responsible for register students and decoding result
   on the examination.
   
   This is controlled by the examination creator by granting and revoking
   roles on the examination. The different kind of roles are contributor,
   examinator and decoder. 

   Questions are assigned one or more correctors that are responsible for
   answer correction. By default the contributor becomes the question corrector,
   but the exam creator can edit correctors list.

** STUDENT RESULTS:

   Students can fetch their own results once correction is finished. The exam
   creator can flag an exam or student as enquiry for investigation.
