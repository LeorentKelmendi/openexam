     MySQL 5.5. performance notes
    ********************************************

MySQL 5.5 with InnoDB performs really bad on some hardware/software configurations. The problem 
comes from ACID-compliance demanding sync after each transaction. 

This is not an problem when running on hardware RAID with cached controller. On desktop and 
virtual servers, the performance can be really bad as seen below (~18 insert/sec).

The solution is to run on real servers or accept possible data loss (on second). In some 
cases, setting disk flush to O_DIRECT is the cure.

    # Flush transaction each second (approximately):
    innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit  = 0

    # Configure disk flush method (fsync being default):
    innodb_flush_method             = O_DIRECT

Other performance improvements includes pitching up log and buffer sizes:

    innodb_buffer_pool_size         = 512M
    innodb_log_file_size            = 128M

** Benchmark test:

   o) The first one with innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 1 (default setting):

    bash> sysbench --num-threads=16 --max-requests=10000 --test=oltp --oltp-table-size=500000 --oltp-test-mode=complex --mysql-db=dbtest --mysql-user=dbtest --mysql-password=dbtest run
    sysbench 0.4.12:  multi-threaded system evaluation benchmark

    No DB drivers specified, using mysql
    Running the test with following options:
    Number of threads: 16

    Doing OLTP test.
    Running mixed OLTP test
    Using Special distribution (12 iterations,  1 pct of values are returned in 75 pct cases)
    Using "BEGIN" for starting transactions
    Using auto_inc on the id column
    Maximum number of requests for OLTP test is limited to 10000
    Threads started!
    Done.
