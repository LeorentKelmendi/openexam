** General:

    Performance monitors are implemented in two pieces: 

        1. Collectors are the backend that feeds data to the performance table.
        2. Counters are the front that queries the performance table.

    If performance data is expected to be useful except as live data (e.g. for tuning system
    performance), then store data in the performance table. The performance table is excluded
    from audit (unconditionally by overriding system configuration).

    The counters can be plugged in to act as the data source for controllers serving data. Its
    important that counters are fast and low on resources. A counter is not required to have a
    collector, it could be all live data, possibly gathered from some network service.

** Extending:

    The performance monitor framework are located under app/library/Monitor/Performance

** Collectors:

    Register the collector in the Performance model if it's going to save performance data. 
    Collectors don't have to save data, one exception could be a collector that is sending
    live data using a socket connection.

** Counters:

    New counters can be added in app/library/Monitor/Performance/Counter. To make the counter 
    available, register it in the Performance class.

** Other:

    Consider install a resource monitoring tool like Munin:
