    **************************************************


We have two levels of access restriction:

    1. Thru Apache web server configuration.
    2. Dynamic for student access.

Apache web server configuration:
---------------------------------

The Apache configuration provides static access restriction based on IP-address 
ranges. It is set on locations and is kind of first level of access restriction.

Dynamic for student access:
---------------------------------

This is handled through the models Lock and Access. They is only intended to be
utilized for filtering student access to an exam during the examination time.

The Access model defines the single hosts, ranges or subnets allowed to access 
the examination view. One or more records in the related access table are associated 
with a single exam.

The Lock model contains active locks that is either pending or approved. If the
exam is flagged as lockdown, then the student view should not be accessable unless
an approved lock has been acquired.

The lock model connects the student, exam and computer together. 

Unified access restriction is performed by the open() method in the Access class 
(see Core/Exam/Access.php). The open() method should be called from any part of
the system that is accessed using the student role (Web/AJAX, REST or SOAP).

The open() method has these duties:

    1. Prepare the exam for student if required (e.g. assign empty answer in
       randomized mode).

    2. Ensure that access rules (as dictated by the Access model) is enforced.

    3. Lock an exam to a specific computer. If extended lock down policy is activated,
       it could also include checking the computer state (e.g. firewall rules) or 
       force a specific browser to be used (not relying on user agent).

The Access class provides the close() method that should be called in response 
upon a student request to close the active exam. Once closed, it should not be
possible to call open() again (in locked mode) to gain access to the exam again.

An pending lock can be approved calling the approve() method in Access class. An
lock can be release (by authorized persons) by calling the release() method.
