An person granted the admin role can impersonate as another system user (acting as
them using their login name) by passing the impersonate as request parameter with
the user to impersonate as value:

    ?impersonate=<user>

Once granted, the impersonation is saved in the calling user session:

    'impersonate' => array(
        'actor'         => <user principal>,    // The admin user
        'impersonated'  => <user principal>     // The impersonated user
    )

The impersonation is injected at dispatch time (thus supporting both Web/AJAX, REST 
or SOAP requests). Explicit request for impersonation is handled by User::impersonate()

Impersonation is restored by passing an impersonate request without a value or by 
calling User::impersonate() with null as argument:

    ?impersonate=<user>
