        Description of the system roles.
    *************************************************************


** Builtin roles:

    The system defines built-in roles that are global (admin and teacher), roles that are 
    connected with an exam (creator, contributor, invigilator, decoder and student) and 
    roles that are connected with an question (the corrector role).

    It's possible to redefine the meaning of these roles by modifying their definitions
    in app/config/access.def. This config file is the foundation for ACL that is tightly 
    integrated in the data model, see models.txt for more information.

** Custom roles:

    In addition to the built-in roles, it's possible to define custom roles by adding them
    to app/config/access.def. Custom roles are global and gives access to both the web 
    interface (GUI) and the web service interface.

    Custom roles are meant to be defined for integration with other systems. A custom role
    is typical injected from an authenticator plugin class.

** Description of builtin roles:

    o) teacher:

        The teacher role grants permission to create exams. One that creates an exam
        is implicit assigned the creator role on that exam.

    o) creator:
    
        This role is assigned to the creator of an exam. This is an implicit assigned
        role. 

        The one in possession of this role can change exam properties, assign correcting
        teacher on questions (added by self) and grant exam roles to other people.

    o) contributor:

        A contributor can add questions. By adding a question, he/her is automatic assigned
        as the corrector of that question.

    o) corrector:

        The person that has been assigned the role as correcting answers on a question.
        An question might have multiple correctors.

        It's fully possible for a person to be the corrector of an question without been
        granted the contributor role on that exam.

    o) invigilator:

        The invigilator has permission to change exam schedule and add/remove student from
        an exam. The invigilator role is meant to be assigned to exam assistants, that is,
        persons that are physical present during the exam.

        Because an invigilator has access to the student real identity, it's not recommended
        that the same person is a corrector on the same exam.

    o) decoder:

        The exam decoder has permission to decode the exam. By decoding the exam, students
        real identity is revealed. After decoding its no longer possible to modify scores
        assigned to answers (changing the results).

    o) student:

        The student role is assigned to anyone registered on a exam. The student role is only
        granted access to the part used during exam and the result service (for downloading 
        corrected answers/the exam graduation).

    o) admin:

        The admin role gives full permission to any part of the system. The primary purpose
        is to "bootstrap" users by granting them the teacher role or performing restricted 
        tasks as "upprättning" (changing the result scores after an exam has been decoded).
