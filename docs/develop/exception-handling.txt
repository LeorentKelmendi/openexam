** Handling exceptions:

    Each sub system (GUI, AJAX, REST and SOAP) should provide an method that 
    gets called for handling exceptions:

        public function exceptionAction($exception) 
        {
            // Report exception and inform peer...
        }

    This method decides how to handle the exception and reported back to end user 
    in a format suitable for the current request (e.g. HTML for GUI or JSON for AJAX 
    request). The exception handler gets called from dispatcher on beforeException 
    events.

    The base class controller is responsible for installing exception and error
    handlers. Trapped errors are wrapped in ErrorException and thrown to be handled
    by the current dispatched controller.

** Throwing exceptions:

    The code that throws an exception can set the optional exception code to an
    HTTP status code (e.g. 403). When trapped by the GUI exception handler it will
    be displayed using the generic exception report view.

    The core class OpenExam\Library\Core\Error provides constants for some common
    HTTP status codes:

        throw new \Exception(
            'You don't have permission to land on the moon', 
            Error::UNAUTHORIZED
        );

    If the status code is unset, then its handled as HTTP status 503. For GUI this
    means that the exception is displayed as an internal server error.

** Dispatch exceptions:

    The dispatcher itself will throw errors. These are forwarded to the sub system
    exception handler method. Its recommended that the exception handler is not 
    logging page not found exceptions:

        if ($exception instanceof DispatcherException) {
            switch ($exception->getCode()) {
                case Dispatcher::EXCEPTION_ACTION_NOT_FOUND:
                case Dispatcher::EXCEPTION_HANDLER_NOT_FOUND:
                    // Handle 404 errors...
        }

        $this->report($exception);
        // Report exception back to peer...

** Reporting exceptions:

    The exception handler (the controller action) should use the common base class 
    report() method to log the exception, except for trivial exceptions like page
    not found errors.
