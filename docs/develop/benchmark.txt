** Apache (AB test):

   Use the ab* test tools bundled with Apache web server for simple performance test. First login 
   using a web browser, open the cookies manager and copy the session cookie value. Then use it to 
   run various test:

   o) Measure answer updates. The payload is in post.txt:

        bash$> ab2-ssl -n 1000 -c 20 -C PHPSESSID=hebdam42udmo63i9caaqp4l7u6 -p post.txt \
                https://localhost/openexam/core/ajax/student/answer/update 

   o) Measure index page loading:

        bash$> ab2-ssl -n 1000 -c 20 -C PHPSESSID=hebdam42ud15t63i9caaqp4l7u6 \
                https://lcoalhost/openexam/exam/index

   Use standard tools to observe effect (e.g open sockets, memory usage, database threads).

** Simulation:

   Compile the tool under admin/simulate to run real world simulations on the system. While
   ab*-test measure connection statistics, the simulate tool has intrinsic knowledge and can
   simulate normal work seen on the system (e.g. someone reading all questions before going
   on to answer one of them). 

   As it knows the system, it can also parse response and detect errors, giving a more complete
   view of overall performance.

        bash$> cd admin/simulate
        bash$> make
        bash$> ./simulate -f clients.txt
