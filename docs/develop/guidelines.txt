    Development guidelines for OpenExam
   ****************************************************


** Netbeans IDE:

   Use Netbeans PHP as IDE. Format the source code using "Alt + Shift + F". Using 
   common formatting makes the source code easier to read and helps to keep diffs
   and commits small.

** Composer:

   Never make changes or fix code in the vendor directory. Any changes are lost 
   on update. Make changes in affected packages (when possible), composer.json or 
   inside Composer hooks. 
   
** Security:

   a) Security is a number one priority.

   b) All access to models should be authenticated. Authorization should be done to
      unsure the caller are allowed to access any result-set or object coming from
      the model.

   c) Security scans should be performed regular.

** Locations:

   o) Everything under phalcon-mcv/app is application code. 

   o) Static content (e.g. HTML, CSS and Javascript) goes under phalcon-mcv/public. 

   o) Data files (e.g. cache, schemas and log-files) belongs in sub-directories 
      under phalcon-mcv, e.g. phalcon-mcv/cache. Some of these locations can be 
      overridden by the system administrator.

** Optimization:

   a) Don't attempt to optimize code "by making assumption" on code execution. 
      Use a profiler first. Usually, any bottleneck is in other areas than the 
      expected. 

   b) Use builtin classes and functions whenever possible.

** Patches:

   Place patches (unified diff -Naur) in admin/patch/. Apply patches against vendor
   using a Composer hook.
