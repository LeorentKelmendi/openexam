This application uses PHPUnit (phpunit/phpunit) for running unit tests. PHPUnit
should be automatic installed by Composer (composer update).

Manual install using Composer:

    bash$> cd ${appdir}/openexam-phalcon-mvc
    bash$> composer update --dev
        # -- or --
    bash$> composer install phpunit/phpunit

Run the unit tests either from within Netbeans or from the command line:

    bash$> cd ${appdir}/openexam-phalcon-mvc/tests/phalcon-mvc
    bash$> phpunit --bootstrap bootstrap.php \
                   --configuration configuration.xml .

The unit test can be limited to specific groups of unit tests (defined by @group 
attributes in the unit test file):

    bash$> cd ${appdir}/openexam-phalcon-mvc/tests/phalcon-mvc
    bash$> phpunit --bootstrap bootstrap.php \
                   --configuration configuration.xml \
                   --group security .

For testing classes that requires dependency injection, derive the test case from 
OpenExam\Tests\Phalcon\TestCase instead of PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase. The supporting
class TestCase is located in tests/support/Phalcon.

Successful running unit test on models depends on test data. Run this task to insert
table data into the database to satisfy e.g. the relational tests:

    bash$> cd ${appdir}/openexam-phalcon-mvc
    bash$> php phalcon-mvc/script/unittest.php --setup

Logging of unit test diagnostics (to stdout) can be redirected to a log file by 
configuration in phalcon-mvc/app/config/system/config.php
