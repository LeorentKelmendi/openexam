   PCRE AND UNICODE CHARACTERS

** INTRODUCTION:

   Supporting input validation when using unicode (UTF-8) raises some issues
   that needs to be taken care of. One of these is that the standard set of
   patterns are no longer working.

** THE PROBLEM:

   Consider the case of matching an input string containing letters, digits,
   punctuation and spaces. Using the ASCII character set we would do some-
   thing like this:

     if(preg_match("/^[[:ascii:]]+$/", $str)) {
         // ... do something
     }

   or

     if(preg_match("/^[[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$/", $str)) {
         // ... do something
     }

   This won't work with the swedish character set.

** MATCHING UNICODE CHARACTERS:

   To match unicode characters, use the character properties for unicode
   (\p{XY}) in the regex pattern. Also, make sure to append /u as match
   modifier.

   These character properties are simple and useful:

      \p{L} - match letter
      \p{N} - match number
      \p{Z} - match whitespace
      \p{P} - match punctuation

   The unicode equivalent pattern string for [:ascii:]+ seems to be a combination
   of the above:

      (\p{L}|\p{N}|\p{Z}|\p{P})+
